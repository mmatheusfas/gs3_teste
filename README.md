# GS3 Test

Technical challenge for GS3 Technology.

## Description

The idea was to follow a Figma prototype. The main goal was to be exactly the same as Figma.
I used Flutter and Dart for this project. I chose the MVC architecture pattern because I thought it was ideal, 
considering the small scale of the application and the lack of need for a robust architecture such as layers, for example.
